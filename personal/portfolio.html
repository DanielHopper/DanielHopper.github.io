                    <h2>Every superhero needs an origin story</h2>
                <p>And although mine might not involve some nuclear explosion that gave me superpowers, I still consider it to be a very important part of who I am today. Back in high school, I was a very different person. For the most part, I was just an artsy Drama student who just happened to have a knack for Math and Computers. I didn't quite set off on my path of Computer Science until grade 10, when it was time to pick elective courses. I was short one, and I saw a course with "Computer" in the name, so I picked it up right away. Mostly because I'm obsessed with technology.</p>

                <p>This course was ICS2O1 - Introduction to Computer Science. It was my first real taste of the world of CS, but looking back on it, it didn't do the field any justice. All we did was follow instructions on programming GUIs in Visual Basic, which barely scratches the surface. Still, I was intrigued, and decided to enrol in ICS3U1 and ICS4U1. Every year I found it more and more interesting, and we began to learn more about what Computer Science really is as the years went on. In fact, I enjoyed it so much, that all my University applications were for Computer Science programs</p>
                <p>But at that point, I was applying for very superficial reasons. I was good at it, it was interesting, and I had a lot of fun doing it. Although those are valid reasons, I didn't yet have the love that I currently have for Computer Science.</p>

                <p>It wasn't until my first programming contest that I realized I made the right decision. 11 of my classmates and I enrolled in <a href="http://ecoo.org/">ECOO</a> 2013. This was a day-long contest where teams of 4 compete in writing programs to solve problems. Points were awarded for correct solutions, but also for completion time. So, it was somewhat of a race. The pressure was definitely on as I stepped into this classroom, and students began plugging in their laptops and getting ready with their teammates. It looked no different than a LAN party - but then, the timer started. Everyone dove into the packages we were given and began to solve the problems within them. You could hear frantic typing all around the room. The environment was absolutely electrifying. I felt the rush of solving these logic problems faced in front of me, and the satisfaction of implementing them in a computer program. I was hooked. 
                <p>That was when I knew I made the right decision.</p>
                <p>That was when I knew I loved Computer Science.</p>

                    <p>So I got in. I'm now a student at my dream school, taking my dream program. It all ended up coming together quite nicely, and I found myself in a really good spot as I started </p>

                    <h2>Somewhere in the Between</h2>
                    <p>Remember when I said up there that I passed as an artsy drama student back in high school? Well, even though I couldn't continue theatre what with the business of university, I'm always seeking out new creative outlets. In particular, I've held music and photography very close to me, and I couldn't imagine my life without them</p>
                    <p>Although a life of Computer Science is what I signed up for, I need a break from it every once in a while. Not because it tires me out, but because I need to make time to feed my other passions. Take music for example. For me, it's almost meditative to be able to take a break from my code and strum a few chords on my guitar, or drum along to a song that's been in my head.
