                    <h2>Every superhero needs an origin story</h2>
                <p>And although mine might not involve some nuclear explosion that gave me superpowers, I still consider it to be a very important part of who I am today. Back in high school, I was a very different person. For the most part, I was just an artsy Drama student who just happened to have a knack for Math and Computers. I didn't quite set off on my path of Computer Science until grade 10, when it was time to pick elective courses. I was short one, and I saw a course with "Computer" in the name, so I picked it up right away. Mostly because I'm obsessed with technology.</p>

                <p>This course was ICS2O1 - Introduction to Computer Science. It was my first real taste of the world of CS, but looking back on it, it didn't do the field any justice. All we did was follow instructions on programming GUIs in Visual Basic, which barely scratches the surface. Still, I was intrigued, and decided to enrol in ICS3U1 and ICS4U1. Every year I found it more and more interesting, and we began to learn more about what Computer Science really is as the years went on. In fact, I enjoyed it so much, that all my University applications were for Computer Science programs</p>
                <p>But at that point, I was applying for very superficial reasons. I was good at it, it was interesting, and I had a lot of fun doing it. Although those are valid reasons, I didn't yet have the love that I currently have for Computer Science.</p>

                <p>It wasn't until my first programming contest that I realized I made the right decision. 11 of my classmates and I enrolled in <a href="http://ecoo.org/">ECOO</a> 2013. This was a day-long contest where teams of 4 compete in writing programs to solve problems. Points were awarded for correct solutions, but also for completion time. So, it was somewhat of a race. The pressure was definitely on as I stepped into this classroom, and students began plugging in their laptops and getting ready with their teammates. It looked no different than a LAN party - but then, the timer started. Everyone dove into the packages we were given and began to solve the problems within them. You could hear frantic typing all around the room. The environment was absolutely electrifying. I felt the rush of solving these logic problems faced in front of me, and the satisfaction of implementing them in a computer program. I was hooked. 
                <p>That was when I knew I made the right decision.</p>
                <p>That was when I knew I loved Computer Science.</p>

                    <h2>Now what?</h2>
                    <p>So I got in. I'm now a student at my dream school, taking my dream program. It all ended up coming together quite nicely, and I found myself in a really good spot as I started my undergraduate career. Being given this awesome opportunity, I wanted to make sure I did it right. So I spent the better part of my summer leading up to first year planning out a path for myself: I would take the Software Engineering option with a minor in Management Studies. Seemed like a solid plan, and it definitely looked good on paper. </p>

                    <p>It wasn't until about a year later that I realized that this academic path that I had meticulously planned out wasn't one I wanted to follow. As I learned more about the various topics in the world of Computer Science, I realized that there were so many more interesting courses I could take in my upper years if I wasn't bound by the restrictions of this plan. This realization was the first step in an important paradigm shift on school. Labels and grades became less important. I began to abstract away all the overhead of school that happens on paper, to focus more on the material itself. </p>

                    <p>I highly value my education. I'm thankful for it every single day. My simple paradigm shift on education has helped me out a lot during my time at Waterloo. Often I see people ride through school by memorizing information and not necessarily retaining any of it. I strive to truly understand and thoroughly learn what I'm studying. Computer Science is a discipline rooted in logic and mathematics with lots of interesting problems, so it isn't hard at all to become absorbed in the material.
                    Looking at academics from this point of view is harder than it sounds, but I find it easier when you really love what you're studying. </p>

                    <p>And I definitely do.</p>


                    <p>As I moved into this mind set, around my 2A term, I found myself in a group of like-minded friends. It was here that my network of Computer Science students began to grow. As I made more and mort valuable connections with people in the same frame of mind as me, I began to embrace the extracurricular culture of Computer Science.</p>

                    <p>There are many benefits of having a solid group of people with similar interests to you. But not only did we shared interests - we also shared passions. We all had a passion for building, for creating, and for innovating. Naturally, this led us to the culture of Hackathons.</p>

                    <p>I mentioned that the ECOO contest was an affirming experience for me earlier, but Hackathons pushed it even further. The term "Hackathon" is used to describe an event in which a bunch of students get together for a weekend and immerse themselves in tech culture. The main event is a contest of sorts, where you build a project from scratch and demo it at the end of the weekend, but there's so much more to Hackathons than projects and demos. There's networking, there's tech talks, there's mentorship, and there's 1000 other people with the same passions as you in the same room. It's an event that fosters creativity and innovation, more than just solving problems like the ECOO contest.</p>

                    <p>Naturally, I feel right at home at Hackathons. In fact, as I write this, I'm on my way to <a href="http://yhack.org">YHack 2015</a>! After attending my first Hackathon in first year, the inspiration from the electrifying atmosphere stuck with me. I began doing projects on my own in my spare time, and felt the inspiration and drive to create when things came to my mind. It was this culture of creation and innovation that paved the path for my growth and development at Waterloo thus far, and continues to do so to this day.</p>

                    <h2>Somewhere in the Between</h2>
                    <p>Remember when I said up there that I passed as an artsy drama student back in high school? Well, even though I couldn't continue theatre what with the business of university, I'm always seeking out new creative outlets. In particular, I've held music and photography very close to me, and I couldn't imagine my life without them.</p>

                    <!-- embed 500px page -->
                    <p>Although a life of Computer Science is what I signed up for, I need a break from it every once in a while. Not because it tires me out, but because I need to make time to feed my other passions. Take music for example. For me, it's almost meditative to be able to take a break from my code and strum a few chords on my guitar, or drum along to a song that's been in my head. 
                    </p>
                    <p>I'm a big believer of keeping things in balance. I've noticed that I operate better when I'm not focusing on one thing for too long, and take some time away to focus on different things. For example, if I'm working on a problem for class for a really long time, I'll take a break to do something that I enjoy that's as far away from it as possible. My usual go-to is rock climbing. It's a physical activity with a little bit of problem solving mixed in, and is definitely one of my favourite hobbies.

                    <h2>A Taste of the Future</h2>
                    <p>Or, more accurately, a sampling platter of the future. This is the story of my co-op experience thus far at Waterloo.</p>

                    <p>Setting off into the stream of co-op terms ahead of me, I had one long term goal in mind: try as many new things as humanly possible. I wanted try out every single part of the tech world - front end, back end, mobile, you name it. I wanted to use the opportunity of multiple co-op terms to my advantage, to both gain an understanding of everything and see what it is I really like. So far, I've been doing pretty well with that.
                    </p>

                    <p>My first position was at a Toronto startup called <a href="polar.me">Polar</a>. They used to be in the business of making mobile apps for media publishers, but at the time I joined recently pivoted to the native advertising business. The role I had there was a fairly entry-level role that turned into more than I expected it to be. Initially, I was doing simple scripts to be run in the browser to inject advertisements onto publisher webpages. This was my introduction to javascript and web development in general. While at this company, I was given the responsibility of maintaining some of their older apps written using Backbone.js, a common MVC framework. I got experience with this framework, deploying apps with Cordova, all while fulfilling the duties I was hired for. I was a beginner at the time, so all the work I was doing was fairly simple, but it helped me develop a solid understanding of all the technologies I was using.</p>

                    <p>My second position was in Vancouver, at a company called <a href="hootsuite.com">Hootsuite</a>. They are a social media platform that allows users to schedule and organize all of their social media activites across all networks from one dashboard. While I was there, I dug deeper into front-end web development, by working on the publishing module on their dashboard project. I was also the head developer on their chrome extenstion, which was a new experience. This was my first time having actual ownership over a real project. Hundreds of thousands of people use this extension, and being the one to develop and deploy it was really exciting!</p>

                    <p>Now, for the most part, I'm spreading myself out just for the sake of trying new things. I'm extremely interested in tech, but one of my deepest interests lies in entrepreneurship. It's always been a dream of mine to be an entrepreneur in the crazy world of tech, but I'm not going to get there with just business and soft skills. I want to understand as many levels of the software world as I can before I shift focus to entrepreneurship. At that point not only would I have a solid idea of what it would take to build a product, but I'd be able to build it myself as well. The world has too many "Whartonites seeking code monkeys" - I want to be the founder who has the idea, and implements it too.</p>

                    <p>One of my major influences in following this path is the CEO of Polar, Kunal Gupta. He was a Waterloo student as well, in engineering, and started his company near the end of his undergrad. He, too, took on a bunch of different technical co-ops before starting his company. He took his time to explore, to find what he liked, and eventually bring it all together in 4th year when he started Polar. He was the one who advised me to do the same, way back in my first co-op term, and it's definitely stuck with me. </p>

                    <h2>To Infinity, and Beyond</h2>
                    <p>Buzz Lightyear. What a visionary.</p>

                    <p>What's my definition of success? Huh. Good question. To be honest, it's pretty hard to give success a formal definition. Success, in my eyes, is a very dynamic concept. I'd even consider myself pretty successful in my current state.</p>

                    <p>Success is loving what you're doing. Success is being surrounded by a group of awesome people in your life who support you and share your passions. Success is being inspired to do something, then doing it.
                    Success is the voice inside you that's yelling out "hey good job dude, keep doing the thing".</p>

                    <p>I often daydream about the future. I often leave this time period to imagine myself 1 year, 3 years, 8 years from now. Each time, I imagine myself with this feeling of success, and take note of what it is that causes it. The one common theme? Immersion. Immersion in my passions. Immersion in the world of tech and entrepreneurship.</p>

                    <p>Getting there is the exciting part. In the near future, I'm going to be applying to Velocity. I don't have a company idea yet, but the environment there is optimal for coming up with one. I'm sure I'll meet loads of people just like me - wanting to take their knowledge in tech further than just Software Engineering - and that's really exciting to me.</p>

                    <p>And who knows where it'll go from there? It's been a dream of mine since first year to one day apply to <a href="ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a>. Being involved in Velocity will definitely be a good start at that. And it also helps that the president (Sam Altman) already thinks waterloo students are pretty rad.</p> 

                    <!-- embed Sam Altman tweet about uWaterloo -->


                    <p>But that's not to say I wont be successful if I don't do all of those things. Right now those are my goals - but goals change, people change, and I might find something along the way that changes my mind entirely. But if there's one thing I do want to keep constant, it's the immersion.</p>

                    <p>I've been throwing the word "immersion" around a lot. Allow me to explain my motivation for doing so:
                    </p>
                    <p> Earlier this term, my CS341 prof Kevin Lanctot told us a story about the person he shared an office with when he first came to this university. He wasn't your usual grad student - in fact, he was about the age of a high school student. Of course, Kevin was appalled, and he studied this guy to figure out how he got so far ahead at such a young age. It was clear that he was a child prodigy of sorts, but Kevin noticed something else very significicant about him. Every time he would do something, whether it be research, a project, etc., he would do one thing: completely immerse himself.</p>

                    <p>This really struck a chord with me, because it made so much sense. How could you possibly not be successful, if you are spending your time being 100% immersed in what you are doing?</p>

                    <p>So I want to take that further. I don't want to immerse myself just in a single activity, but rather, a mindset. A culture. A group of people with a common goal.</p> 


                    <p>That's my definition of success.</p>
