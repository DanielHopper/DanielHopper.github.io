                <h2>Task</h2>
                <p>At the dawn of our project, a crucial task that was immediately necessary for success was to get clubs interested in our service. As a group, we had the idea of going out to the annual clubs and societies day to gauge interest and strike up conversations with execs. This was successful at first, and we got many leads through emails and positive responses, but this didn’t translate well to our response rate when we later tried to email them. We were then left with the same task we began with: how do we get clubs on board? My natural approach is to dig right into <strong>problem solving</strong>, and I immediately began to <strong>brainstorm</strong> other ways we could reach out, and I <strong>listed a few possible solutions</strong>. There was the possibility of going to club meetings, hosting an SLC booth, but there was a deeper <strong>problem that I identified</strong> -- we’re a brand new service, and have no credibility. Why would a club chose us to boost their reach and engagement when we have no proven results?</p>
                <h2>Actions</h2>
                <p>With all the <strong>information gathered</strong> from our initial market studies and club response rate, it was clear that we needed to work harder for these clubs to get on board with us. We rely heavily on external factors like club interest to keep our project alive, and although this is a challenge for us, there are ways we can bootstrap our success in the early stages to earn the trust of everyone else. I <strong>chose the course of action</strong> that involved internal network marketing, not external. An old friend of mine recently started out a club by the name of “Meditation Explorers of UW”. Given that his club was new and didn’t have much members, he would be the perfect candidate for using our service. I reconnected with him, and it turns out he had already gotten the initial email blast, but wasn’t too sure of the organization or its reputation so didn’t decide to go any further. However, since he now knows that I’m running it, he was more than happy to jump on board, and <strong>I took the initiative</strong> to start pitching some initial ideas for our first campaign together.</p>
                <h2>Result</h2>
                <p>Due to my <strong>quick thinking and problem solving</strong>, our team is now in a much better position for growing our project. Not only did bringing the meditation explorers club into our active circle of clubs increase our numbers, but it introduced a unique element of diversity into the clubs we are servicing. We initially thought that the clubs who would initially be inclined to use our service would be newer clubs looking for more exposure. Since we started out with some more established ones, we were worried that this initial vision would be lost, but the introduction of the meditation explorer brings balance to our offering, and gives us a balanced portfolio to market ourselves with. </p>

                <h2>Task</h2>
                <p>Among the final deliverables for the SLTP sits the final report. Since this is our last opportunity to formalize our project results before the presentation, we all realized that it was important to get it right. Not only in terms of the content itself, which we have been accumulating through notes and status updates, but in the presentation itself. Reading longs reports is much easier when they are pleasant to read, and good presentation of the data will make it easier to digest. As a group, we all knew presentation of the report would benefit us for this reason, but I had the idea of <strong>taking it a step forward</strong>.</p>                 
                <h2>Actions</h2>
                <p>In order to maximize our visual quality, I decided to take the <strong>initiative</strong> and do the formatting by myself. This wasn’t an effort to split up the group and take away work from people, but rather an ‘<strong>above and beyond</strong>’ improvement to the work we already collaborated on. I have a history of graphic design experience, as well as access to professional software like Adobe InDesign, so I knew I could provide the group with a great deal of benefit by <strong>spearheading</strong> this design project.</p>                 
                <h2>Result</h2>
                <p>The end result was well worth the extra time put in. Attached at the bottom of this reflection is the report in its entirety. My design leadership combined with our collaborative report writing resulted in an easy to read portfolio for our project. The markers of this report made special notes on the professionalism of this presentation – it was a <strong>step above</strong> a simple Microsoft Word export, and because of that <strong>extra work</strong> it added an air of professionalism. </p>
