                <h2>Task</h2>
                <p>At the dawn of our project, a crucial task that was immediately necessary for success was to get clubs interested in our service. As a group, we had the idea of going out to the annual clubs and societies day to gauge interest and strike up conversations with execs. This was successful at first, and we got many leads through emails and positive responses, but this didn’t translate well to our response rate when we later tried to email them. We were then left with the same task we began with: how do we get clubs on board? My natural approach is to dig right into <strong>problem solving</strong>, and I immediately began to <strong>brainstorm</strong> other ways we could reach out, and I <strong>listed a few possible solutions</strong>. There was the possibility of going to club meetings, hosting an SLC booth, but there was a deeper <strong>problem that I identified</strong> -- we’re a brand new service, and have no credibility. Why would a club chose us to boost their reach and engagement when we have no proven results?</p>
                <h2>Actions</h2>
                <p>With all the <strong>information gathered</strong> from our initial market studies and club response rate, it was clear that we needed to work harder for these clubs to get on board with us. We rely heavily on external factors like club interest to keep our project alive, and although this is a challenge for us, there are ways we can bootstrap our success in the early stages to earn the trust of everyone else. I <strong>chose the course of action</strong> that involved internal network marketing, not external. An old friend of mine recently started out a club by the name of “Meditation Explorers of UW”. Given that his club was new and didn’t have much members, he would be the perfect candidate for using our service. I reconnected with him, and it turns out he had already gotten the initial email blast, but wasn’t too sure of the organization or its reputation so didn’t decide to go any further. However, since he now knows that I’m running it, he was more than happy to jump on board, and <strong>I took the initiative</strong> to start pitching some initial ideas for our first campaign together.</p>
                <h2>Result</h2>
                <p>Due to my <strong>quick thinking and problem solving</strong>, our team is now in a much better position for growing our project. Not only did bringing the meditation explorers club into our active circle of clubs increase our numbers, but it introduced a unique element of diversity into the clubs we are servicing. We initially thought that the clubs who would initially be inclined to use our service would be newer clubs looking for more exposure. Since we started out with some more established ones, we were worried that this initial vision would be lost, but the introduction of the meditation explorer brings balance to our offering, and gives us a balanced portfolio to market ourselves with. </p>
